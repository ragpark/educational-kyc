### Example: Awarding Organisation Search

Use the built-in client to retrieve awarding organisations for a given subject
and course.

```python
import asyncio
from app.services.ofqual_awarding_orgs import OfqualAOSearchClient


async def demo():
    client = OfqualAOSearchClient()
    results = await client.search(subject="history", course="gcse")
    for org in results:
        print(org.get("name", org))


asyncio.run(demo())
```

Alternatively you can call the FastAPI endpoint directly:

```
GET /ofqual/awarding-organisations?subject=history&course=gcse
```
