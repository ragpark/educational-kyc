### Example: Awarding Organisation Search

Use the built-in client to retrieve awarding organisations for a given subject
and course.

```python
import asyncio
from app.services.ofqual_awarding_orgs import OfqualAOSearchClient


async def demo():
    client = OfqualAOSearchClient()
    results = await client.search(subject="history", course="gcse")
    for org in results:
        print(org.get("name", org))


asyncio.run(demo())
```

Alternatively you can call the FastAPI endpoint directly:

```
GET /ofqual/awarding-organisations?subject=history&course=gcse
```

### Example: Ofqual Register Search

You can search both organisations and qualifications by course and location using `OfqualAOSearchClient`:

```python
import asyncio
from app.services.ofqual_awarding_orgs import OfqualAOSearchClient


async def demo():
    client = OfqualAOSearchClient()
    organisations = await client.search(course="maths", location="london")
    qualifications = await client.search_qualifications(course="maths", location="london")
    print("Organisations:", len(organisations))
    print("Qualifications:", len(qualifications))

asyncio.run(demo())
```

Or via the new endpoint:

```
GET /ofqual/search?course=maths&location=london
```

### Using the MCP Wrapper

The `KYCContextSource` class provides a simple Model Context Protocol (MCP)
interface to the application's endpoints. Each call returns an `MCPDocument`
containing the raw response and metadata.

```python
import asyncio
from app.mcp_wrapper import KYCContextSource


async def demo():
    source = KYCContextSource(base_url="http://localhost:8000")
    health = await source.health()
    print("Health status:", health.content)

    orgs = await source.search_awarding_orgs(subject="maths")
    print(orgs.content)

asyncio.run(demo())
```
