### Example: Awarding Organisation Search

Use the built-in client to retrieve awarding organisations for a given subject
and course.

```python
import asyncio
from app.services.ofqual_awarding_orgs import OfqualAOSearchClient


async def demo():
    client = OfqualAOSearchClient()
    results = await client.search(subject="history", course="gcse")
    for org in results:
        print(org.get("name", org))


asyncio.run(demo())
```

Alternatively you can call the FastAPI endpoint directly:

```
GET /ofqual/awarding-organisations?subject=history&course=gcse
```

### Example: Ofqual Register Search

You can search both organisations and qualifications by course and location using `OfqualAOSearchClient`:

```python
import asyncio
from app.services.ofqual_awarding_orgs import OfqualAOSearchClient


async def demo():
    client = OfqualAOSearchClient()
    organisations = await client.search(course="maths", location="london")
    qualifications = await client.search_qualifications(course="maths", location="london")
    print("Organisations:", len(organisations))
    print("Qualifications:", len(qualifications))

asyncio.run(demo())
```

Or via the new endpoint:

```
GET /ofqual/search?course=maths&location=london
```

## MCP Wrapper Usage

The application exposes a lightweight wrapper that speaks the
**Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. This wrapper lets downstream AI agents
retrieve context from the service in a standardised document format.

```python
from app.mcp_wrapper import KYCContextSource

source = KYCContextSource(base_url="https://your-kyc-service.com")
health_doc = await source.health()
print(health_doc.content)
```

Each method on `KYCContextSource` returns an `MCPDocument` which contains the
raw content, metadata about when it was retrieved, and the originating URL.
You can use this wrapper to fetch awarding organisation data or verification
statuses without dealing with HTTP directly.
